Wow what a game

How will Reading recover from this... Third from bottom in the Premier league, no league wins so far this season.  The Capital One cup came as a welcome distraction.  A game against a less than full strength Arsenal.

Things were looking good, looking real good, 4-0 up after 35 minutes with the away fans signing 'Bring our Arsenal Back'

Roll forward 45 minutes (or 50 minutes with the additional injury time) and the scores are 5-5...

30 minutes of extra time and we Reading have somehow lost a game they were totally in control of...

This could be the catalyst of the downward spiral or the kick Reading need to aclimatise to life in the top flight of English football.
