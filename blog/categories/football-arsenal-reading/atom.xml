    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow what a game</p>

<p>How will Reading recover from this... Third from bottom in the Premier league, no league wins so far this season.  The Capital One cup came as a welcome distraction.  A game against a less than full strength Arsenal.</p>

<p>Things were looking good, looking real good, 4-0 up after 35 minutes with the away fans signing 'Bring our Arsenal Back'</p>

<p>Roll forward 45 minutes (or 50 minutes with the additional injury time) and the scores are 5-5...</p>

<p>30 minutes of extra time and we Reading have somehow lost a game they were totally in control of...</p>

<p>This could be the catalyst of the downward spiral or the kick Reading need to aclimatise to life in the top flight of English football.</p>
